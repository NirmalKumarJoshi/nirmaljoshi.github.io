So you might be thinking do these two actually mean the same or not? Yes, if we look into a broader picture these two terms are different. In many cases these terms are used as synonyms and there is no harm in saying that.
Some professionals are baffled by the way people so easily swap these two terms and however for many this is totally fine to interchange them. It totally depends if you are not going into the depth.

In this article we will be diving deep into slight differences between these two terms to get the better understanding of whether we should swap it in real or not?

## Cybersecurity

- Cybersecurity — or computer security — involves a range of practices, processes, and technologies intended to protect devices, networks, programs, and data from attacks and unauthorized access.
- Cybersecurity deals with the prevention of ransomware attacks and spyware injections and social media compromise.
- In simpler words it is concerned with protecting electronic devices and mobile devices against attacks in cyberspace.
- Cybersecurity professionals deal specifically with [advanced persistent threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#:~:text=An%20advanced%20persistent%20threat%20%28APT%29%20is%20a%20stealthy,network%20and%20remains%20undetected%20for%20an%20extended%20period).

## Information Security (Info Sec)

- Information security is about protecting the information, typically focusing on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability aspects of the information.
  - Confidentiality – Refers to preserving authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, including a means for protecting personal privacy as well as proprietary information.
  - Integrity – Refers to defense against inappropriate information destruction or modification, including ensuring information authenticity and non-repudiation.
  - Availability – Refers to ensuring reliable and timely access to as well as the use of information.
- In simpler term it refers to the protection of company data in all formats, which include digital and paper-based information as well as the structures in which they are housed(within an organization).
- The job of an information security professional is to understand and identify what confidential information is critical and analyzing ways to secure it.

Hope this article provides some insights on the basic difference between the most important terms in IT Security.
