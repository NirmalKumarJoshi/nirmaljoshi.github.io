Whenever we hear about the term [Information Security](https://nirmaljoshi.me/2021-12-25-cybersecurity-and-informationsecurity/), the first thing comes up is the term IT RISK. When I started learning about Risk Management, the thing happened with me was I got through different terminologies. Here, I’ll try to share what I understood while learning about RISK in very simple terms.

Before we directly reach to the ‘R‘ term, we would first connect our dots with few of the following terminologies which would help us understand ‘R’ in a better way-

- **Assets**: Anything which provides benefits to organization, it could be anyone/anything of importance. Example: An employee, a server, etc.
- **Vulnerabilities**: This seems to be a tough term right but its not, its means the weakness that allows an asset to be exploited. Example: An unlocked open server room.
- **Threats**: This term is actually a threat to people who hear it for the first time, so just to simplify it’s an action that exploits a vulnerability’s potential to harm an asset. Example: Stealing a server from server room using the open unlocked door.
- **Threat Agent**: The one who does everything which means a person initiating a threat.

Let’s define the ‘R’ term that is **RISK**– In simple words risk is nothing but a possibility of something bad happening. You might be wondering why I got you through so many terms if RISK is that simpler, its because when we talk in terms of information security the RISK completes its definition using the above terms.

Information Security Risk is the probability of a threat agent successfully exploiting a vulnerability in an asset through threat actions. The formula which defines it is:

**Threats x Vulnerability = Risk**

Coming to the few more terms which are highly used while using RISK are:

- Likelihood: It defines the level of certainty that something will happen.
- Impact: It is the actual harm caused by the threat.

Thanks for reading this and hope it was relevant to you and helped you in some or the other way.

Cheers :)
