In simple to simpler terms, cloud computing is service offered through the internet to users on-demand, services include- servers, storage databases, netowrking, software, analytics, intelligence and many more.
The top most benefits of using cloud services are- availability, flexibility and scalability, to add on the resource cost management becomes easy. 

Looking into the benfits in detail:

- Cost: Organization's/individual's cost of buying or renting hardware and software resources get reduced to a lot of extent. The cost is totally based on the usage of resources.
- Speed: The self-provisioned services with no manual intervention makes cloud computing super-fast.
- Reliability: The data backup capability gets enhanced in terms of cloud computing, the business continuity and disaster recovery gets easier because the cloud instances can easily be cloned.
- Security- The most important thing to look upon, many cloud service providers tend to follow set of standards and policies for secured services. Compliance certifications add a lot to security posture of a CSP.

## Types of Cloud Computing: Based on Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**:Users over the internet use cloud services in which the infrastructure is based on the cloud computing company. However, the public cloud is not secure and organizations with sensitive information are not ought to use this cloud. The information is available for everyone who uses the cloud. Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet.
- **Private Cloud**: A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise your existing infrastructure, security and compliance.


## Types of Cloud Services

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: The service that provides hardware and software tools for application development for users is called PaaS. Various components are incorporated with the organization’s underlying infrastructure using this service. Also, it provides database management systems and programming language libraries. Editing, compilation, testing, and version management can be done in this service. 
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.
