Hi, I am Nirmal Joshi currently working in the field of Information Security. Here's why I started this blog site:

- Documenting things I learn and experience
- Make a concept easy to understand, like totally in layman terms

What else do you need?

### What's within the blogs

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just jump to blogs and it will answer **all** your questions.
